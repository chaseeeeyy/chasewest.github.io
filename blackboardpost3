There aren't just one or two websites that are my favorites but rather a multitude of ones that I enjoy. As much as people will roll their 
eyes or think it is silly, I instantly go to Wikipedia when I hear about or come across anything I find even remotely interesting. This 
applies to films, music, bands, types of cheese, conspiracy theories, historical figures, etc. As much as I enjoy reading, I think the 
inclusion of several photos as well as their font and overall page set up draws me to their site. (Side note: Yes, I realize it's not a 
very credible source, I still enjoy just reading the articles for leisure, haha.) Twitter as well as Facebook (yes, I'm embarrassed to 
say) are also a few of my "go to's". Despite not always being the most sociable person, I do enjoy the social media aspects of these sites 
in terms of being able to share articles and other pieces that interest me as well as seeing others'. This reminds me of last week's 
Lanham's reading, primarily the "stuff and fluff" idea. Some of these sites, such as Facebook and other social media platforms, are 
chock full of people's different ideas and probably have swayed my opinions on a thing or two in the past. Overall, I guess I just 
really enjoy the Internet. Can anyone imagine life without it? When it comes to my web portfolio, I would ideally like it to just be a 
good representation of me and my writings. A personal page or profile can say a lot about a person.
