I'm not completely sure yet on what I'm going to cover for my text to hypertext project, although I have several ideas. I have tons of 
writings that I have done for my other classes, so I'm going to try and find something from that selection. In terms of questions, I don't 
have too many at this point although I will soon, no doubt. At this point I'm just anxious. Reviewing the process was not too confusing, 
although I'm not really understand the "breaking it down into parts", part.
