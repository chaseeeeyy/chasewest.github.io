This has been somewhat of a difficult semester. First off, working full time and going to school full time both present their own set of challenges. Doing both together, however, can be incredibly difficult. Sometimes it is just hard to find that balance. Admittedly, I am not a fan of online classes. I find that it is too easy to forget that you have work due, hence making things late at times. Although this isn’t on purpose, I tried to do everything I could to be proactive and prevent it from happening.
	The portfolio, much like the text to hypertext project, presented its own set of challenges. Wordpress was incredibly difficult, but looking back, hindsight is 20/20. I have learned some incredible things that I don’t know I would ever have learned had I not taken this course. I realized first off that the audience is the most important. It’s important to keep in mind that we’re always writing for them. I look at user accessibility now in a whole new light. Literacy, credibility, and copyright all affect web development in major ways, so I am glad to have learned more about these. In the development of this portfolio, I had to retrace all of my steps and construct an outline in order to have a good project outcome. I spent a lot of time researching topics we have covered as well as revisiting the texts we have read. All in all, this class has been an interesting experience and I am glad to have taken it. Thank you, Dr. Andrews!
